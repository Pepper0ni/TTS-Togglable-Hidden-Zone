# TTS-Togglable-Hidden-Zone
A Simple Scripte that, when attached to an Object and said the button is clicked, spawns a hidden zone for that player.

The size and position of the hidden zone can be configured from inside the script. These is relative to the object.

If the zone touches the object, the button cannot be pressed by any other player (Except Black/GM), meaning it is good for creating safe-zones where a player can do secret things in peace.

Zones will persist and remain connected to the object even when saving and loading games, or when undoing.
